### v0.1.1
    * First PyPi publication of the package.

### v0.1.2
    * Updated docs, README.md, and added 'whitening' flag for NegentropyCost instances.

### v0.1.3
    * Focused on the documentation, improved the symbolic functions, added ability to use finite difference approximations to gradient and hessian, updated function arguments and class names to be more consistent. Changed LinearModel to accept the time-series signal as an input so that users do not need to perform hankelisation. Overall just general QoL changes.
